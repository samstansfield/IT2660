# Binary Trees

This assignment works with Binary Trees.  There are two parts to it.  The first one implements the binary tree as a set of Treenodes, similar to a linked list.  It also has a TreeNodeWrapper class to help enforce encapsulation.  For a balanced tree, the insert and fetch methods are very fast.  There are also algorithms for balancing an unbalanced tree, these can be tricky to implement..  A completely unbalanced tree is not different from a Linked List.  Besides the speed associated with a Balanced tree it is also easy to read the tree off in soreted order.  This is often done with a recursive function that works its way through the nodes of a binary tree.
