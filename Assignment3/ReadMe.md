# Stacks and Queues.

In this assignment Stacks and Queues were used to implement simple algorithms.  A Stack is based on the "LIFO" (Last-In-First-Out) principle while a Queue is based on the "FIFO" (First-In-First-Out) principle.

A stack is used to convert an algebraic expression to "Postfix" notation.  A Queue is used to check if a phrase is a palindrome (reads the same forwards and backwards).
