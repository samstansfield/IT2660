# Stacks and Queues.

In this assignment Stacks and Queues were used to implement simple algorithms.  A Stack is based on the "LIFO" (Last-In-First-Out) principle while a Queue is based on the "FIFO" (First-In-First-Out) principle.

A stack is used to evaluate an expression that is inputted in "Postfix" notation.  The idea of "Postfix" is that there are no parantheses and the operations are placed after the operands.  For instance:  (a+b)xc = ab+cx = acxbcx+, where x represents "times".  A Stack can also be used in an algorithm which converts algebraic notation to postfix (this is more easily done with a Binary Tree).

A queue is used to check whether a given phrase is a palindrome, that is, does it read the same backwards and forwards.  This ignores spaces and punctuation.
