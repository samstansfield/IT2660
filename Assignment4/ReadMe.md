# Single and Double Linked Lists

A Linked List is a data structure where each node has a pointer to the next node in the list.  This particular set of programs keeds the linked list sorted.  The requires that any new node may have to be placed beteeen existing nodes.  During Insert and Delete it is crucial to keep track of the links to and from adjacent nodes.  The big advantage of the linked list is the ability to fill in spaces in fragmented memmory.  The disadvantage is that it can be time consuming to Fetch a node if it is far down the list.  

With a Doubly Linked List one may start at either end of the chain of links.  This is more complicated because one must keep track of links in both directions.  

Note that some of the questions require drawings.  These are in the included .jpg files.
