#  Student Data and Arrays

Most assignments have a set of programs to complete and a set of questions to answer.  In each assignment the programs are contained in folders with a description of the program.  The uploaded .doc files contain the question answers.

For these two programs a basic structure and test program were created.  The basic Student class was created.  It is used in both a Java array and in an ArrayList.  The Student class is used often in the course.  The "RandomStudent" class was written by the instructor for the course.
