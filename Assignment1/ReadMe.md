#  Assignment 1, Student Data

There are four specific assignments that are part of this overall assignment.  Two are programming and the other two are questions to be answered.  In general, the A and C assignments are questions and the B and D assignments are programs.  

I will simply upload the question files in github, the questions are all answered.  The programs are included as zip files.  The zip files also include output from the programs.  This will be generally how all the assignments are arranged.

For these two programs a basic structure and test program were created.  In version "B" it is used in an array.  In version "D" it is used in an ArrayList.  The "RandomStudent" class was written by the instructor for the course.  The Student Class created here is used several times later in the course.
