# IT2660

This class is a course in data structures and algorithms.  The class itself did not require a repository and it was not encouraged to build one.  I am transferring the work to here.  In the process I will also add comments about each program.  All programs are written in Java.

Each assignment also had a list of questions to be answered about the current material.  Most assignments have two programs.
