# Recursion

Recursion happens when a function calls itself.  That is, it relies on evaluation of the same function with different parameters.  Recursion can be tricky to use.  It is rarely faster or more memory efficient than a program for the same task written without recursion.  Although, it may often have less overall code.  It works best for a calculation for which there are many choices at each step.  The idea is to try all possible choices until a set of choices is tried that allows the overall function to exit.  The program here solves a "Sudoku" puzzle, essentially by trial and error.  There are two big problems with recursive routines, they can be difficult to debug and can lead to memory overflow errors.  The reason for the overflow errors is that all variables are pushed onto the stystem stack whenever a new call of the function is made.  It is possible to get into an "infinite loop" of function calls which causes the stack to overflow.  There is a general process for creating recursive functions that will work in most cases.
