# Sorting

This assignment is about sorting lists of numbers.  The first part implements the "Bubble" sort.  This is probably the easiest sort to implement and one of the slowest.  The idea is that the program goes through the list of unsorted numbers and then the nodes "bubble up" until they are in the right place.  It has order n^2.

In the second part of the assignment the goal is to compare the times for three different sorting algorithms.  This compares the "Bubble", "Heap" and "Merge" sorts.  I chose the Heap and Merge sorts because I had never done either one before.
