# Hashing

Hashing is a method for accessing data structures that is typically faster than other types of structures.  The idea is that the key itself is used in some way to calculate the address of the node in the structure.

The assignment uses two basic hashing methods.  The fisrt is the "Perfect Hash" where there are exactly the number of nodes needed.  The addresses of the nodes are fixed and an simple calculation tells the computer the address explicitly.

The second part of the assignment uses a Java "HashMap" structure.
