# Hashing

Hashing is a method for accessing data structures that is typically faster than other types of methodolgy.  The idea is that the key itself is used in some way to calculate the address of the node in the structure.  It is generally not a sorted list and producing one requires sorting on the spot.

The assignment uses two basic hashing methods.  The first is the "Perfect Hash" where there are exactly the number of nodes needed.  The addresses of the nodes are fixed and an simple calculation tells the computer the address explicitly from the key.  The program portrays a seating chart at a theatre, the combination of row and seat number tells the computer where to find the relevant node.  

The second part of the assignment uses a Java "HashMap" structure. The big advantage of the HashMap is that Insert and Fetch methods tend to be pretty fast.  The big disadvantage is that a typical hashed data structure can be many times larger than the number of nodes.  This is done to reduce the number of "collisions".  Collisions occur when two different keys lead to the same address.  This can happen because of the way the computer calculates the address from the key.  When a collision occurs the program will then tell the computer where to look next for another possible address for the node.  Collisions do slow down the process of finding the node.  If there is more empty space in the main data structure then it is more likely to not have many collisions.
