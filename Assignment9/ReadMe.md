# Graphs

Graphs are more complicated than trees.  A node may have any number of edges which connect to it.  The edges may or may not have a direction associated with them.

For the program the names of cities and some connecting airline routes.  The Adjacency and Transitive Closure matrices were calculated.  An element of the Adjacency matrix is 1 if there is an edge from the starting at the row number and ending at the column number.  For directed graphs it is not symmetric.  The Transitive Closure matrix has a 1 if there is a path from the row number to the column number.
